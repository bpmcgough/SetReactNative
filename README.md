# SetReactNative
Set (http://www.setgame.com/) app built in React Native

Hey there, thanks for checking out my app. Read below if you want to play it.

## IMPORTANT ##
This app is not completed but is playable on your phone with the following caveats: 
- The view is configured for iPhone 5s. Until I make the styling reactive, if you'd like to configure it to your specific 
  device just change the button components this.state.style.height and width (to 100 if you're using iPhone 6)
- You'll notice that the newly generated cards remain gray, pretend like they're not gray.

Have fun!
