# SetReactNative
Set (http://www.setgame.com/) app built in React Native

Hey there, thanks for checking out my app. This is my first time ever using React, so all critiques are welcome. Read below if you want to play it.

## IMPORTANT: iOS only supported thus far ##
This app is not completed but is playable on your phone with the following caveats:
- The view is configured for iPhone 5s. Until I make the styling reactive, if you'd like to configure it to your specific 
  device just change the button components this.state.style.height and width (to 100 if you're using iPhone 6)
- You'll notice that the newly generated cards remain gray, pretend like they're not gray.

## To play on device: ##
- Open Xcode (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/, 4GB)
- Open SetReactNative >> ios >> Setproject.xcodeproj
- In Xcode
  - Plug phone into computer, make sure phone is selected
  - Press play button

Disfrutalo!
